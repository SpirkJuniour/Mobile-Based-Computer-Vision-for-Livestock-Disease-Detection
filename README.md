### System Components

1. **User Authentication**: Supabase Auth with role-based access (Farmer/Veterinarian)
2. **Database Layer**: Supabase PostgreSQL for user profiles, livestock records, diagnoses, and vet cases
3. **Image Upload & Storage**: Supabase Storage for livestock images
4. **Disease Detection Engine**: ONNX Runtime with YOLOv11/YOLOv8 models for on-device inference
5. **Role-Based Dashboards**: Separate interfaces for farmers and veterinarians

## Design

- **Visual Style**: Inspired by Airbnb (clean, modern, smooth transitions)
- **Color Palette**:
  - Primary: #0066b2
  - Background: #FFFFFF
  - Card Color: #F8F9FA
- **Logo**: Minimalist hoof icon
- **UX**: Transparent modals, animated transitions, card-based layout

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK (3.9.2 or later)
- Dart SDK
- Supabase account
- Android Studio / Xcode (for mobile development)

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd mifugo_care
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Supabase Setup**
   
   Create a Supabase project at [Supabase](https://supabase.com/)
   
   - Get your Supabase URL and anon key from Project Settings → API
   - Update `lib/main.dart` with your Supabase credentials:
     ```dart
     await Supabase.initialize(
       url: 'YOUR_SUPABASE_URL',
       anonKey: 'YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY',
     );
     ```

4. **Set up Database Schema**
   
   Run the **complete consolidated database setup script** in Supabase SQL Editor:
   ```sql
   -- Run the complete schema file: supabase_complete_schema.sql
   ```
   
   **Important**: This consolidated file (`supabase_complete_schema.sql`) replaces all individual SQL files and contains everything needed for setup.
   
   This single script will:
   - Create all required tables (`users`, `livestock`, `diagnoses`, `vet_cases`, `notifications`)
   - Set up Row Level Security (RLS) policies for secure data access
   - Configure database triggers for auto-creating user profiles on signup
   - Create all necessary indexes for optimal query performance
   - Set up storage policies for image buckets
   - Configure auto-update triggers for timestamps
   
   **Quick Setup**: 
   1. Open `supabase_complete_schema.sql` in this repository
   2. Copy the entire contents
   3. Paste into Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
   4. Click "Run" to execute
   
   **Note**: If you have existing data, the script uses `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` to avoid conflicts. For a fresh setup, you can uncomment the DROP TABLE statements at the beginning (use with caution!).

5. **Set up Storage Buckets**
   
   In Supabase Dashboard → Storage, create these buckets:
   - `livestock_images` (Public bucket, authenticated uploads)
   - `diagnosis_images` (Public bucket, authenticated uploads)
   
   The storage policies are already configured in the SQL script, so buckets will work automatically once created.

6. **Run the app**
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## Machine Learning Integration

The app uses ONNX Runtime for on-device disease detection (`lib/services/disease_detection_service.dart`), enabling real-time inference without requiring internet connectivity.

### Model Architecture

- **Detection Model**: YOLOv11 Medium (`animal_pathologies_best.onnx`)
  - Detects and localizes disease symptoms in livestock images
  - Output: Bounding boxes with confidence scores
  
- **Classification Model**: YOLOv8 Medium (`cattle_diseases_best.onnx`)
  - Classifies detected regions into specific disease categories
  - Output: Disease labels with confidence percentages

### Model Training

See [TRAINING_INSTRUCTIONS.md](TRAINING_INSTRUCTIONS.md) for detailed training guide.

**Quick Start:**
```bash
# Navigate to ML directory
cd ml

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Train all models (recommended)
python train_all.py

# Or train classification only
python train_classification_only.py

# Monitor training progress
python monitor_training.py
```

**Training Configuration:**
- Epochs: 50 (configurable)
- Target Accuracy: 99-100%
- Early Stopping: Enabled (patience: 50 epochs)
- Data Augmentation: Applied automatically

**Automated Training:**
- Use `ml/train_and_monitor.py` for automatic monitoring
- Models auto-export to ONNX format when training completes
- Automatic copy to Flutter `assets/models/` directory

### Model Integration

1. **Place trained ONNX models** in `assets/models/`:
   - `animal_pathologies_best.onnx` (detection model)
   - `cattle_diseases_best.onnx` (classification model)

2. **Models are automatically loaded** by `DiseaseDetectionService` on app startup

3. **Camera integration** is ready in `upload_image_screen.dart`:
   - Real-time image capture
   - Preprocessing pipeline
   - Model inference
   - Results display with confidence scores

### Inference Pipeline

1. **Image Capture**: Camera or gallery selection
2. **Preprocessing**: Resize, normalize, format conversion
3. **Detection**: Run YOLOv11 detection model
4. **Classification**: Run YOLOv8 classification on detected regions
5. **Post-processing**: Filter results by confidence threshold
6. **Display**: Show disease labels, confidence scores, and recommendations

### Performance Optimization

- **ONNX Runtime**: Optimized for mobile inference
- **Model Quantization**: Reduced model size (future enhancement)
- **Async Processing**: Non-blocking inference for smooth UI
- **Caching**: Model loading cached after first use

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue: Supabase connection errors**
- Verify Supabase URL and anon key are correct
- Check network connectivity
- Ensure RLS policies are properly configured

**Issue: Models not loading**
- Verify ONNX models exist in `assets/models/`
- Check `pubspec.yaml` includes models in assets section
- Run `flutter clean && flutter pub get`

**Issue: Image upload fails**
- Verify storage buckets are created in Supabase
- Check storage policies are configured correctly
- Ensure user is authenticated

**Issue: Authentication errors**
- Verify database trigger is set up for auto-creating user profiles
- Check RLS policies allow user insertion
- Review Supabase Auth configuration

**Issue: ML inference slow**
- Ensure models are optimized ONNX format
- Check device performance capabilities
- Consider model quantization for smaller devices

### Debug Mode

Enable verbose logging:
```dart
// In main.dart
import 'package:flutter/foundation.dart';

void main() {
  if (kDebugMode) {
    // Enable debug logging
  }
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

### Logs
