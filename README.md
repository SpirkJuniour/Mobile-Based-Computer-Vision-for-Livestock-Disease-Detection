# MifugoCare 🐄

**Mobile-Based Computer Vision for Livestock Disease Detection**

An AI-powered mobile application for livestock health monitoring and disease diagnosis designed for farmers in Kenya and East Africa. Built with Flutter and powered by machine learning, MifugoCare helps farmers detect livestock diseases early through image analysis.

> **🎉 NEW: Real ML Model Deployed!** The app now uses TensorFlow Lite with **84.95% accuracy**!  
> See [Quick Test Guide](QUICK_TEST_GUIDE.md) to test it in 1 minute.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK 3.0 or higher
- Android Studio / Xcode for platform development
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Mobile-Based-Computer-Vision-for-Livestock-Disease-Detection.git
   cd Mobile-Based-Computer-Vision-for-Livestock-Disease-Detection
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Configure Supabase** (Optional - works offline without it)
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Add your Supabase credentials
   - Or use environment variables:
   ```bash
   flutter run --dart-define=SUPABASE_URL=your_url --dart-define=SUPABASE_KEY=your_key
   ```

4. **Run the app**
   ```bash
   # Android
   flutter run

   # iOS
   flutter run -d ios

   # Web
   flutter run -d chrome
   ```

## 🤖 Machine Learning Model

### ✅ FULLY FUNCTIONAL - Production Ready!

The app now uses **real TensorFlow Lite inference** with a trained model!

#### Model Status
- ✅ **Trained Model Deployed**: `livestock_disease_model.tflite` (8.4 MB)
- ✅ **Validation Accuracy**: **84.95%** (excellent for medical imaging)
- ✅ **Training Accuracy**: 99.8%
- ✅ **On-Device Inference**: 200-500ms per prediction
- ✅ **11 Disease Categories**: Fully operational

#### How It Works
1. **User captures image** → Camera screen
2. **Image preprocessed** → Resized to 224×224, normalized
3. **TFLite inference** → Model predicts disease with confidence
4. **Results displayed** → Disease name, confidence, symptoms, treatments

#### Model Specifications
- **Architecture:** MobileNetV2 + Custom Layers (transfer learning)
- **Input Size:** 224×224×3 (RGB)
- **Output Classes:** 11 disease categories with softmax probabilities
- **Format:** TensorFlow Lite (.tflite) - optimized for mobile
- **Training Data:** 753 images (567 train, 186 validation)
- **Best Epoch:** 5 (early stopping applied)
- **Validation Accuracy:** 84.95%
- **Inference Time:** 200-500ms on mobile

See `ML_FULL_INTEGRATION_COMPLETE.md` and `QUICK_TEST_GUIDE.md` for complete documentation.
